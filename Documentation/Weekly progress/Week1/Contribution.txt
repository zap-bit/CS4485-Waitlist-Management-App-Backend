Designed and refined the system architecture for the Waitlist Management application
  - Generated an initial architectural diagram using Gemini and iteratively refined it.
  - Identified core system modules such as waitlist logic, capacity tracking, notifications, and future AI prediction components.

(6hrs) 
Researched API contract designs and industry standards and created the API specification
  - Explored Swagger/OpenAPI standards for endpoint documentation.
  - Defined endpoints, request/response schemas, validation rules, and error handling.

(3hrs) 
Explored AI tools and prompt engineering techniques to improve development workflow
  - Tested tools like Claude, Gemini, and Codex (GitHub-synced).
  - Built small prototype apps to understand AI-assisted development.
  - Researched prompt engineering strategies to generate scalable architecture ideas, API designs, and modular code.

(4hrs) 
Built additional AI-assisted prototypes for learning and experimentation
  - Created a simple AR fruit slash game (Gemini).
  - Developed a pet adoption interface (Claude, Figma prompt comparison).
  - Launched a simple HTML, css based blog using Gemini to code and Pages to deploy, to understand GitHub functionality better (NeuroFrontiers).

Leader role
Created Github repositories and added team members as collaborators, recorded meeting minutes, sceduled team meeting and documented weekly contributions from each member.

Brainstormed and evaluated multiple implementation approaches for the frontend, backend, AI model, and database design
   - Defined core system modules, including waitlist logic, capacity management, notification handling, and predictive modeling components
   - Explored different UI/UX layouts for both the Staff Dashboard and Attendee View, focusing on usability 
(2hrs) 
Refined and structured AI prompts to assist with building the frontend components, backend services, ML models, and database schemas
   - Organized prompts into modular sections to streamline development of individual features
   - Designed prompts to generate scalable, production-ready code rather than simple prototypes
   - Left select architectural decisions open-ended to allow for further team discussion before finalizing implementation direction
